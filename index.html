			Good afternoon! We need to get better at timesheets, starting right now. This is starting to disrupt people's paychecks. Here are some particulars:
			<ul>
				<li>Foremen need to make sure all relevant information is filled in- job number, estimated % complete, total hours, etc. If the foreman is authorized an extra hour, that needs to be reflected on the in/out times.</li>
				<li>Crew members- please do not fill in ST/OT/DT hours- that's all automatic when we do payroll. Just fill in your in/out times and sign. Foremen will total everything up and sign at the bottom.</li>
				<li>Everyone needs to write in their employee number in the box by their name- this is a good check and balance against time entry problems.</li>
				<li>Everyone needs to sign the signature block. NO ONE SHOULD EVER SIGN FOR SOMEONE ELSE.</li>
				<1I>Foremen need to download whatsapp and send Will a message once downloaded to be added to the group that way everything can be done in one location rather than multiple messages from everyone.</1i>
			</ul>
