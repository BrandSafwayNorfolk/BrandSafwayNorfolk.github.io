		Good evening, all-
    </p>
	<p>
    	I can't say enough about the effort from the guys today in the USS IWO JIMA welldeck- great job all around. JT and Hassaun- excellent job at the leading edge. The communication, the professionalism- y'all knew the plan and you executed it to perfection. I have to give the game ball to Hassaun- very impressive work today. Delvontae, Ty, Keon- great job on that rope. I saw the teamwork, everyone jumping in- y'all were pulling up faster than we could install at several points. Tae- you worked it all day, and we need to see about putting you on ASAP. Will, Charles, Brandon- great job keeping the ground moving. Y'all were three moves ahead all day- just the way it's supposed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
		I hope everyone enjoys their Christmas- make sure to check dispatch tomorrow evening for Tuesday job assignments. JT- you'll be taking over the welldeck, and we'll get you all the support you need.
    </p>
    <p>
		One more time- it was a pleasure working with everyone today. We've set the standard- 16' x 48' in a day- now it's time to keep it moving.
    </p>
    <p>

			Good afternoon! We need to get better at timesheets, starting right now. This is starting to disrupt people's paychecks. Here are some particulars:
			<ul>
				<li><span style="background-color:yellow">Time forecasts for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday need to be in by 0900 tomorrow.</span></1i>
				<li><span style="background-color:yellow">Foremen need to download whatsapp and send Will a message once downloaded to be added to the group that way everything can be done in one location rather than multiple messages from everyone.</span></1i>
				<li>Foremen need to make sure all relevant information is filled in- job number, estimated % complete, total hours, etc. If the foreman is authorized an extra hour, that needs to be reflected on the in/out times.</li>
				<li>Crew members- please do not fill in ST/OT/DT hours- that's all automatic when we do payroll. Just fill in your in/out times and sign. Foremen will total everything up and sign at the bottom.</li>
				<li>Everyone needs to write in their employee number in the box by their name- this is a good check and balance against time entry problems.</li>
				<li>Everyone needs to sign the signature block. NO ONE SHOULD EVER SIGN FOR SOMEONE ELSE.</li>
				
			</ul>
